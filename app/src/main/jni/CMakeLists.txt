# This is an attempt to port the .mk files over to CMake.
# Looks like CMake is the way to go (for now) for all native android
# projects.
#
# Please don't try to use this file as a reference anywhere. I barely
# even know what cmake is, let alone how to write it. The way I write it,
# it's even more rigid than makefiles, which kinda defeats the whole
# purpose of the damn thing.

# Don't try to use this for anything but the android build.
# You've been warned.

# Android Studio seems to use this version
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.1)

# Build prerequisites first (yeah, by including whole files)
